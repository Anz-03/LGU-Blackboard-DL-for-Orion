# LGU Blackboard Downloader

An extension to download all you need in the LGU (aka CUHKSZ) Blackboard

The orignal code was release by the Chromium authors in a demo.
There are two modifications made:

1. The orginal source code of manifest v2 have been adapted to be compatible with v3.
2. And some modifications have been made to meet the specific requirements of the extension.


## Usage
